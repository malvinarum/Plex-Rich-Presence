**PlexRPC** is a modern, lightweight, and user-friendly application that syncs your Plex media status to your Discord profile. 

Unlike other scripts that require editing complex JSON config files, PlexRPC features a **Unified Setup Wizard** that handles everything for you—from secure login to custom library settings.

## 🌟 New in v2.1

* **🔔 Automatic Update Checks:** The app now smartly checks for updates on startup. If a new version is available, a convenient "Update Available" button will appear in your System Tray menu.
* **🛡️ Enhanced Security:** All API communication is now verified with secure client headers, ensuring a stable and safe connection to the metadata backend.
* **🔧 Core Improvements:** Includes the optimizations from v2.0 (Music Support, Config Reset) with added stability fixes.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🧙‍♂️ Configless Setup:** A guided GUI walks you through linking your account, selecting your server, and picking your user profile.
* **☁️ Cloud Metadata API:** Powered by a custom backend to fetch high-quality covers from **TMDB** (Movies/TV), **Google Books** (Audiobooks), and **Spotify** (Music).
* **🎧 Audiobook Recognition:** Smartly detects audiobook libraries to display book covers and author details instead of generic placeholders.
* **👥 Multi-User Support:** Works perfectly with Plex Home / Managed Users. You pick exactly which profile to track (great for shared family servers).
* **🚀 "Pro" Architecture:** Runs silently in the System Tray. Configuration is safely stored in your `%APPDATA%` folder.

## 📥 Installation

1.  Download the latest **`PlexRPC.exe`** from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/malvinarum/Plex-Rich-Presence/releases).
2.  Double-click to run.
3.  Follow the **Setup Wizard**:
    * **Login:** A browser window will open. Click "Approve" to link your account securely.
    * **Server:** Choose which Plex Media Server to track.
    * **User:** Select your specific user profile.
    * **Libraries:** (Optional) Check any libraries that contain Audiobooks for enhanced metadata.
4.  **Done!** The app will minimize to your system tray and start updating your Discord status.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**"I want to reset my settings"**
* **Option 1 (Easiest):** Right-click the PlexRPC icon in your System Tray and select **Reset Config**.
* **Option 2 (Manual):** Delete the file: `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\PlexRPC\config.json`

**"It says Idle when I'm playing something"**
* This usually means you selected the wrong **User Profile** during setup.
* If your server has "Admin" and "Kids", make sure you select the one you actually watch on.
